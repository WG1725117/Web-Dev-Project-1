                            <p> In a matter of a week, this new mobile take on Nintendo's long-running role-playing game series has grown astoundingly popular. It has consumed social media conversation, flooded into mainstream news reports and had an impact on the everyday life of many players, in a physical, outside-the-game way.<p>

                            <p> Pokémon Go removed much of the base series’ depth for location-based social activity. Super Mario Run relegated the sophistication of Mario platforming to button taps. Fire Emblem as a series is resistant to that kind of reduction. The strategy role-playing game series is all about lengthy battles, challenging maps and memorable characters whose stories play out over several chapters.<p>

From the revolutionary Super Mario 64 to the beautifully refined Super Mario Galaxy games, Mario has blazed the trail for Nintendo, helping us to better understand why Nintendo sometimes zigged when other video game makers zagged.<p>

                      <p>The US government recently approved a ban on large electronic devices on flights from eight Middle-Eastern countries. Passengers will be forbidden from bringing devices "larger than a cellphone" on board the cabin, meaning laptops, iPads, Kindles, and more will have to be stowed away in the hold.
          The ban will be enforced on flights from 10 airports spread across Jordan, Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Morocco, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The restrictions also apply to tablets and games consoles--including, presumably, the Nintendo Switch, 3DS, and PS Vita. Smartphones will be allowed into the cabin.<p>

          The list of tweaks and changes were detailed on the Capcom Unity website, and will be available for PC players to beta test on March 28 at 1 PM PST/8 PM GMT until April 3 at 12 PM PST/8 PM GMT. The beta client will be available to Steam users and "completely free to play for both current and new players."<p>

          If you head over to the site now, it'll redirect you to a countdown slated to end next Friday, March 31. The background features artwork depicting a misty scene of trees and bushes with a larger, pyramid-like structure in the distance.<p>

                      <p> Neither Pokemon Go developer Niantic nor publisher The Pokemon Company have mentioned that shiny versions of their popular critters would be coming to the game soon, despite both a recent patch and new Water-type event. However, since the only shiny Pokemon sighted so far have been this Water-type pairing, it may be that these rare versions are tied into that event. It remains to be seen whether yellow Magikarp and red Gyarados will be available once the events ends on March 29, and also whether more shiny critters will become available.<p>
