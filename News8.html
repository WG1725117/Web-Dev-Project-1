            <h1 class="ReviewTitle">Street Fighter 5's Online Network Is Being Revamped</h1>
            <p>Capcom Fighters Network, the service underpinning Street Fighter 5's online component, will see some changes as part of an effort to improve the overall experience.
The list of tweaks and changes were detailed on the Capcom Unity website, and will be available for PC players to beta test on March 28 at 1 PM PST/8 PM GMT until April 3 at 12 PM PST/8 PM GMT. The beta client will be available to Steam users and "completely free to play for both current and new players."<p>
            <p>"For new players, they will be able to download the PC client for free and set up a new CFN profile to play for the duration of the test. All data recorded during the beta is for testing purposes only and once the beta has concluded, all replays, Fight Money earned, progress and player data will be deleted. To encourage players to participate in the beta test, all released characters, including Kolin will be unlocked for play."
Those that participate in the beta will also get an opportunity to trial some of the balance adjustments being made to Street Fighter 5 for its second season of content. Capcom has said once this beta period has finished, it will "make further adjustments to optimise the new CFN and will make its full release on both PS4 and PC shortly after."<p>
            <p>"We understand that Street Fighter 5â€™s server performance has been a less than optimal experience for many of our players," reads a statement posted alongside the CFN changes announcement. "The improved CFN experience is the result of rebuilding it from the ground up to address the most pressing issues that will ultimately result in a better online experience.<p>
            <p>The last major content release for Street Fighter 5 was the introduction of Kolin, a fighter that uses the power of ice to summon "deadly icicles" and "frigid blasts." She also uses the Russian martial art of Systema, which is all about using an opponent's momentum against them.<p>
