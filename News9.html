            <h1 class="ReviewTitle">Total War Countdown</h1>
            <p>The official website for the Total War series is now home to a countdown clock, apparently teasing a reveal of a new game in the series.
If you head over to the site now, it'll redirect you to a countdown slated to end next Friday, March 31. The background features artwork depicting a misty scene of trees and bushes with a larger, pyramid-like structure in the distance.<p>
            <p>However, there's speculation (including on places like the Total War subreddit) that this scene depicts Warhammer's Lustria, and that the countdown is for a Total War: Warhammer sequel. The Creative Assembly has plans for a trilogy of Warhammer games, and a recent developer update provided some insight into where things stand on that front.
"Excitement continues to build amongst the development team as the second part of the trilogy comes together, particularly as the distinctive races take shape and their playstyles solidify in campaign and battle," the studio said last week. "We're equally excited at the prospect of sharing details about the gameâ€™s gigantic scale and content with our community and wider fanbase, as those plans come together in parallel."<p>
            <p>Regarding the new historical game, it said, "Our next major historical release is now in full production with the game design locked and asset creation fully underway. The game retains the same strong focus on character design that infused previous major releases, with the key personalities of the period in particular being an early priority for us now; as such there are some vibrant and striking renders plastered around the studio, with eye-catching combat animations garnering some serious attention too."<p>
