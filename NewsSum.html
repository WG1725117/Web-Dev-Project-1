                            <p>BioWare's much-anticipated spacefaring RPG Mass Effect: Andromeda launched last week, though the game has not been without its issues. Now, the developer has published a list of the "main issues" that it is looking to patch with upcoming updates. Much has been made about Andromeda's animations, and one of the tracked issues is for a problem where Ryder can initiate an "unintended animation state" when running in a zig-zag pattern. Another issue concerns squadmates; they can sometimes "repeatedly teleport on top of the player," while at other times they might not follow when instructed to. BioWare is also aware of a problem where Andromeda does not save often enough during missions. You can see all the known issues/bugs in the list below. We'll update this post in the time ahead as bugs are fixed or others appear. Bear in mind that the list below is not exhaustive, but only represents the "main issues" that BioWare is currently tracking at this time.<p>

That's not because of any malfeasance on developer CD Projekt Red's part, but because Sapkowski opted for an upfront payment when he was originally presented with a deal.<p>

                      <p>The US government recently approved a ban on large electronic devices on flights from eight Middle-Eastern countries. Passengers will be forbidden from bringing devices "larger than a cellphone" on board the cabin, meaning laptops, iPads, Kindles, and more will have to be stowed away in the hold.
          The ban will be enforced on flights from 10 airports spread across Jordan, Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Morocco, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The restrictions also apply to tablets and games consoles--including, presumably, the Nintendo Switch, 3DS, and PS Vita. Smartphones will be allowed into the cabin.<p>

However, since the only shiny Pokemon sighted so far have been this Water-type pairing, it may be that these rare versions are tied into that event. It remains to be seen whether yellow Magikarp and red Gyarados will be available once the events ends on March 29, and also whether more shiny critters will become available.<p>
