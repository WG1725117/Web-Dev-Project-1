                            <h2> Resident Evil 7: Biohazard </h2>
                            <p>Here we are at the start of 2017 and we have a brand new Resident Evil game, that’s nothing like any of the games in the franchise prior. Not only is the game nothing like anything that came in the franchise before it, but it was also announced only 6 months prior to its release. No this isn’t an episode of the Twilight Zone, this is real life and Capcom finally seems to have their finger on the pulse of what fans want from some (definitely not all) of their franchises. I want to make it perfectly clear right upfront with this review, I will do my best to not spoil any aspects of the story. Resident Evil 7 is a game best enjoyed with little to no knowledge of the story or what happens in the game.<p>

                            <h2> Nioh </h2>
                            <p> Nioh’s pedigree is rich in elements borrowed from several similar titles, including Bloodborne and Dark Souls, but it ultimately fails to differentiate itself when all is said and done. The Japanese-themed samurai story is intriguing upon initial glance, especially with it’s seemingly extended replay value. However, when you start to peel back the layers and get into the thick of things, you’re left with a shell of its predecessors and superficial title that couldn’t possibly hold a candle to even the least of them.<p>

                            <h2> Horizon Zero Dawn </h2>
                            <p> since being founded in 2000, this Amsterdam-based studio has stuck almost entirely to a single series: the drab sci-fi shooter franchise Killzone. The successes and failures of individual entries in that franchise have varied — 2009's Killzone 2 was arguably a high point, while PlayStation 4 launch title Killzone: Shadow Fall was a disappointment — but regardless, Killzone has never really seemed to catch on in the gaming zeitgeist compared to popular competitors like Halo and Call of Duty.<p>

                            <p> Over the years, the Yakuza Series has become the perfect Ojisan-simulator (“ojisan” is how you’d call, not very respectfully, a middle-aged man in Japan), including so much beyond the main story that reviews would be twice as long if everything was described in detail. Yakuza 0 is different only in the fact that it turns back the clock to the Eighties, so calling the protagonists “ojisan” wouldn’t really be all that appropriate, unless you’re five years old. <p>

                            <p> Going deep undercover has always been an element of the Deus Ex series that's been just on the periphery of what players could do in-game. There were other characters you would encounter that were operatives working as the inside man of a criminal organization, but Adam Jensen himself was always just a facilitator. "A Criminal Past" finally gives players the chance to go under deep cover to rescue an ally that's gone radio silent in one of the most secure augmented prisons on the planet. Combining some excellent stealth gameplay, lots of exploration, and some terrific plotting, it's peak Deus Ex. <p>

                        <p>The US government recently approved a ban on large electronic devices on flights from eight Middle-Eastern countries. Passengers will be forbidden from bringing devices "larger than a cellphone" on board the cabin, meaning laptops, iPads, Kindles, and more will have to be stowed away in the hold.
            The ban will be enforced on flights from 10 airports spread across Jordan, Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Morocco, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The restrictions also apply to tablets and games consoles--including, presumably, the Nintendo Switch, 3DS, and PS Vita. Smartphones will be allowed into the cabin.<p>

However, since the only shiny Pokemon sighted so far have been this Water-type pairing, it may be that these rare versions are tied into that event. It remains to be seen whether yellow Magikarp and red Gyarados will be available once the events ends on March 29, and also whether more shiny critters will become available.<p>
