                            <p>It is said that in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king. In that sense, Halo Wars 2 is the de facto king of real-time strategy games on consoles, where the venerable genre is underrepresented because of the challenges of managing a lot of units at once on a gamepad. Like its predecessor, Halo Wars 2 does a reasonably good job of overcoming many – not all – of those challenges, but compared to the best RTS games on PC, where it also exists, its campaign missions are flat and unambitious, and its distinctive Blitz multiplayer mode sacrifices the stability of a level playing field in the name of fast and unpredictable action.<p>

                            <p> For Honor’s combat is the kind of brutal melee I always wanted, but never thought I’d actually get to play. Its third-person action-game exterior hides a strategically complex fighting game, mixing team-based action with less interesting solo modes, all built on the most flexible and technically complete melee fighting system I’ve ever experienced.<p>

                            <p> Exploring the expansive, frozen Alps of Steep by means of snowboarding, skis, paragliding, or wingsuit is to tour one of the most diverse and visually interesting open worlds I’ve ever gotten lost in - especially in a sports game. Not all of the featured activities are equally fun, and I was disappointed in the lack of statistical customization, but the array of challenges and their satisfying physics that strike a nice balance between realistic and arcadey rarely left me without something new and exciting to try.<p>

                            <p> The allure of the original Dead Rising’s goofy and gratuitous zombie slaughter was the reason I bought an Xbox 360 back in 2006. Dead Rising 4 ratchets that arcadey, hack-and-slash power fantasy and self-aware satire up to new heights. Even when technical issues rear their ugly heads, that feelgood loop of wading into the horde and coming out the other side has me feeling like a bonafide badass. <p>

                          <p>The US government recently approved a ban on large electronic devices on flights from eight Middle-Eastern countries. Passengers will be forbidden from bringing devices "larger than a cellphone" on board the cabin, meaning laptops, iPads, Kindles, and more will have to be stowed away in the hold.
              The ban will be enforced on flights from 10 airports spread across Jordan, Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Morocco, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The restrictions also apply to tablets and games consoles--including, presumably, the Nintendo Switch, 3DS, and PS Vita. Smartphones will be allowed into the cabin.<p>

              The list of tweaks and changes were detailed on the Capcom Unity website, and will be available for PC players to beta test on March 28 at 1 PM PST/8 PM GMT until April 3 at 12 PM PST/8 PM GMT. The beta client will be available to Steam users and "completely free to play for both current and new players."<p>

However, since the only shiny Pokemon sighted so far have been this Water-type pairing, it may be that these rare versions are tied into that event. It remains to be seen whether yellow Magikarp and red Gyarados will be available once the events ends on March 29, and also whether more shiny critters will become available.<p>
